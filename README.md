# Implementing K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm on Social Network Ad Dataset

## Introduction
K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. In this project, we will implement the K-NN algorithm to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their social network ad data.

## Objective
To classify users who are likely to purchase a product based on social network ad data using the K-NN algorithm. We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset for this task is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads).

## Conclusion
By implementing the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm on the social network ad dataset, we can effectively classify whether a user is likely to purchase a product. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the prediction results.
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Error Rate**: Indicates the proportion of incorrect predictions.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of positive identifications that are actually correct.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.

This approach helps in understanding the effectiveness of the K-NN algorithm in predicting user behavior based on social network ad data.
